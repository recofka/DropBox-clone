## My git workflow

In this project I try to use:

- Good commit messages
- Well named branches
- Pull requests with summaries

If you have feedback to improve my git usage: **[please drop me a line!](https://www.linkedin.com/in/deniserecofka)** 

Here is my branching model for this project.

```
master (auto deploys) ______________________
                       \               /
development             \_____________/- pull request
                         \           /
feature/some-feature      \_commits_/- pull request
```



## Future:
Build the following features:
- Show all boxes

## Create React App

This project was scaffolded using the create-react-app cli.
